# Company Car

# Story

When you start working at a multinational company you often get an opportunity to have a company car to make your work easier and more efficient. 
This program will provide administrative tools for the HR group to keep track of the leased cars by the company. 

You can add a new car to the Inventory, when the company buys one and it can be immediately leased to an employee. The fleet can be filtered by car's manufacturer, by color, by city or by drivers to have better overview on it. This way the car fleet can be easily managed and organized.
